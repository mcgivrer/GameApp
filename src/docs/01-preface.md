## Introduction

Welcome to the documentation for the `Demo01Frame` class. This class is a part of a Java-based game or simulation framework, designed to manage and render graphical entities within a window. The `Demo01Frame` class serves as the main application frame, providing the essential functionalities needed to run, display, and interact with a graphical environment.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of the `Demo01Frame` class is to initialize and manage the game window, handle user input, render graphical entities, and maintain the game loop. It offers a structure for developers to create and manage game objects, handle their interactions, and display them on the screen. This class is designed to be a foundation upon which more complex game logic and functionality can be built.

## Key Features

1. **Entity Management**:
    - The `Entity` class, nested within `Demo01Frame`, represents individual game objects. Entities can have various attributes such as position, size, velocity, acceleration, and color.
    - Methods to set position, size, velocity, and other properties of entities to facilitate easy manipulation and control.

2. **Rendering**:
    - Capabilities to render entities on the screen with specific graphical attributes.
    - Handles both filled and outlined shapes, text objects, and supports custom rendering logic.

3. **Input Handling**:
    - Implements `KeyListener` interface to manage keyboard input, allowing users to interact with the game using the keyboard.
    - Provides mechanisms to detect key presses, releases, and to trigger corresponding actions such as resetting the scene or exiting the application.

4. **Game Loop**:
    - Contains a game loop that updates the state of all entities and redraws them at regular intervals.
    - Ensures smooth animations and consistent frame rates for an optimal user experience.

5. **Logging**:
    - Provides logging functionality to keep track of application events, errors, and other significant occurrences.
    - Supports different log levels like INFO, WARN, and ERR to categorize log messages appropriately.

## Usage

To utilize the `Demo01Frame` class, instantiate it and invoke the `run` method with appropriate arguments. This will initialize the game window, start the game loop, and begin rendering entities. Customize the entities and their behaviors by modifying their attributes or extending their functionalities as needed.

## Conclusion

The `Demo01Frame` class is a robust starting point for developing Java-based games or simulations. Its structured approach to managing entities, handling input, and rendering graphics provides a solid foundation for creating engaging and interactive applications. This documentation aims to help developers understand and effectively utilize the capabilities of the `Demo01Frame` class to build their own custom game logic and features.
