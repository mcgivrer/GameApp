## Overview

The `Demo01Frame` class is the main class for a Java game template. It initializes the default components and services
required to create a basic 2D game with a standard game loop. The game loop consists of the following phases:

- **Input**: Captures and processes player inputs.
- **Update**: Computes movements and behaviors of entities within the game world.
- **Render**: Draws entities on an internal buffer and then synchronizes it with the JFrame using a buffer strategy.

This class also includes several nested classes and interfaces to represent game components such as entities, the game
world, materials, and behaviors.

### Key Responsibilities

1. **Initialization**: Setting up the game window and initializing game components.
2. **Game Loop Management**: Handling input, updating game state, and rendering the game screen.
3. **Event Handling**: Processing key events for player input.

### Components

- **Entity**: The basic game object. Represents any object within the game scene.
- **World**: Defines the game context, including the play area and gravity.
- **Material**: Sets physical constants for specific material behaviors assigned to entities.
- **Behavior**: An interface for enhancing the default processing of entities with specific behaviors.

## Class: Demo01Frame

```java
public class Demo01Frame extends JPanel implements KeyListener {
    // Class variables and constants

    // Constructor
    public Demo01Frame() {
        // Initialization code
    }

    // Game loop methods
    private void input() {
        // Capture and process player inputs
    }

    private void update() {
        // Compute entity movements and behaviors
    }

    private void render() {
        // Draw entities on the internal buffer
    }

    // KeyListener methods
    @Override
    public void keyTyped(KeyEvent e) {
        // Handle key typed events
    }

    @Override
    public void keyPressed(KeyEvent e) {
        // Handle key pressed events
    }

    @Override
    public void keyReleased(KeyEvent e) {
        // Handle key released events
    }

    // Other methods and inner classes
}
```

### Methods

- **Constructor**: Initializes the game frame and sets up the necessary components and listeners.
- **input()**: Captures and processes player inputs.
- **update()**: Updates the state of game entities based on player inputs and other factors.
- **render()**: Renders the game entities onto the screen.

### Event Handling

Implements the `KeyListener` interface to handle keyboard events:

- **keyTyped(KeyEvent e)**: Handles key typed events.
- **keyPressed(KeyEvent e)**: Handles key pressed events.
- **keyReleased(KeyEvent e)**: Handles key released events.

## Nested Classes Overview

- **Entity**: Represents any object within the game scene, with attributes such as position, velocity, and graphical
  representation.
- **World**: Defines the game environment, including the play area boundaries and gravity settings.
- **Material**: Provides physical properties like density, friction, and restitution to entities.
- **Behavior**: Interface for adding custom behaviors to entities, allowing for extended functionality and interaction
  within the game world.

### Example Usage

To use the `Demo01Frame` class, create an instance of it and add it to a JFrame:

```java
public class GameApp {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        JFrame frame = new JFrame("Demo01Frame Game");
        Demo01Frame demo = new Demo01Frame();
        frame.add(demo);
        frame.setSize(800, 600);
        frame.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);
        frame.setVisible(true);

        demo.startGameLoop();
    }
}
```

In this example, the `GameApp` class creates a JFrame, adds an instance of `Demo01Frame` to it, sets the frame size, and
starts the game loop.

## Conclusion

The `Demo01Frame` class serves as a foundational template for creating 2D games in Java. It provides a structured game
loop, handles input and rendering, and allows for easy extension and customization through its nested classes and
interfaces.
